# Zig-MD
A Basic Molecular Dynamics Engine in Zig, built for personal education purposes.

Very obvious disclaimer: I made this for myself to learn Zig and some fundamental MD stuff, and also to try my best to explain it.

### Motivations:
I was not overly thrilled at using MD simulations and yet not *truly* understanding what goes on under the hood. 

And I was also bored of only using python all of the time.

### Resources Used:
- The [GROMACS Reference Manual](https://manual.gromacs.org/2024.2/reference-manual/introduction.html)
- The [Zig Language Reference](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/)

## To-Do
- [ ] Particles as objects with parameters
- [ ] System creator, populate the box with however many particles
- [ ] Lennard-Jones interactions
- [ ] Velocity-verlet integrator algorithm
- [ ] Thermostat (simple? modern?)
- [ ] Barostat (")
