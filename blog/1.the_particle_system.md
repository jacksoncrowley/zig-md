# Molecular Dynamics from Scratch in Zig (I)

This blog series details my attempt to build a molecular dynamics engine entirely from scratch.

This first post covers the setup of the basic system, writing an integrator for Newton's second equation for motion, and a simple 2 body harmonic system to test that all is working well.

## Our Basic Physics Engine
In the most simple, barebones way of explaining it, a molecular dynamics (MD) is a box containing particles which act under the laws of classical, Newtonian mechanics.

### Particles/atoms
A particle is can be represented as a `struct`, containing 3-dimensional values corresponding to it's position, velocity, and force in the x-, y- and z-dimensions. It has a mass, and a couple of extra properties (like charge and Van der Waals radius), which I'll skip over for now.

Since Zig doesn't natively handle vector maths such as vector scaling and dot products (which we'll need later), we have to define the vectors ourselves creating the `Vec3` struct.

```zig
pub const Vec3 = struct {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
    z: f32,

    // we can define extra functions like dot product in here
}
pub const Particle = struct {
    position: Vec3,
    velocity: Vec3,
    force: Vec3,
    mass: f32,
};
```


### The system itself
... consists simply of $n$ particles in a box of $x, y, z$.
```zig
pub const System = struct {
    particles: []Particle,
    box_dims: Vec3,
    }
};
```


## What's in a step?

For a given MD step, we first **calculate the forces** acting on our particles at that given time, and then integrate newton's equation of motion to **update the positions and velocities** according to the previous positions, velocities and forces.

note: as $a$ is equal to $F/m$ (where $F$ is force and $m$ is mass, we can simply replace $a$ with $F$ in our simple example as we are implicitly considering all particles have an equal mass, 1.


### Integrating the equations of motion
We will be integrating with the Velocity Verlet method. In practice, this involves three steps:

1. Calculation of the new velocities at half of the timestep as:

$$
v(t+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t) = v(t) + \frac{\Delta t}{2m}\bm{F}(t)
$$


2. Calculation of the new positions as:

$$
r(t+\Delta t) = r(t) + \Delta t \bm{v}(t + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t)
$$

3. Calculate the new forces $\bm{F}(t + \Delta t)$
4. Calculate the last half of the time step velocity update:

$$
v(t+ \Delta t) = v(t+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t) + \frac{\Delta t}{2m}\bm{F}(t + \Delta t)
$$
