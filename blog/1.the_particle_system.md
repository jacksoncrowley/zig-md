# Molecular Dynamics from Scratch in Zig (I)

## The Initial Particle System 

In the most simple, barebones way of explaining it, a molecular dynamics (MD) is a box containing particles which act under the laws of classical, Newtonian mechanics.

## What's in a step?
We will be integrating with the velocity verlet method. In practice, this involves several steps:

1. Calculation of the new positions as:

$$
x(t+\Delta t) = x(t) + v(t+\Delta t) + \frac{1}{2}a(t)\Delta t^2
$$

2. Calculation of our new forces

3. Calculation of the new velocities as:

$$
v(t+\Delta t) = v(t) + \frac{a(t)+ a(t+\Delta t)}{2}\Delta t
$$

note: as $a$ is equal to $F/m$ (where $F$ is force and $m$ is mass, we can simply replace $a$ with $F$ in our simple example as we are implicitly considering all particles have an equal mass, 1.

Either way, the forces from before the positions are updated need to be stored in order to calculate the new velocities.


### Calculating Forces

Each particle in the system interacts with all other molecules by way of the inverse square law:

$F = \frac{k}{r^2}$

Where $F$ is the force, $k$ is the interaction (more on this later), and $r$ is the distance between particles.
